# Price Fixer
Save billions of dollars by not being convinced, by dishonest marketing practices, to buy stuff you don't need.

This is a Chrome extension that searches for all prices on a website and replaces the html with the prices rounded up, so we don't get those nasty **.99**
anymore.

For example: *$99.99* becomes *$100.00* ...BAAMMM!!! Hopefully you'll decide not to buy the product anymore.

*This extension is not finished yet.*
